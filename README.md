# Binary Frequency Shift Keying of a digital message signal
Binary Frequency Shift Keying of a message signal has been performed on MATLAB (Both in time and frequency domain).
Frequency Shift Keying (FSK) is the digital modulation technique in which the frequency of the carrier signal varies according to the digital signal changes. FSK is a scheme of frequency modulation. The output of a FSK modulated wave is high in frequency for a binary High input and is low in frequency for a binary Low input. The technology is used in communication systems such as amateur radio, caller ID, and urgent situation broadcasts. 
In this project, Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) has been used which changes the complexity of Fourier Transform from O(n^2) to O(n*log(n)).
